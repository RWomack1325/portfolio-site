                    <h2>Computer Vision Exercise Tracking</h2>
                      <p class="project-description">Program that uses computer vision to watch a user perform three types of exercises, bicep curls, squats and press ups. 
                        The program is able to count the number of repetitions during the exercise and tell the user to increase their range of motion if needed. 
                        The program is able to save data about workouts and generate graphs of rep numbers over multiple workouts, as well as generate graphs of BMI over time.

                  <p>I built this program in 2023 for my A Level CS project. I was inspired by exercise video games and hardware
                    to create something that could help people properly perform exercises and track their progress. I chose to
                    use Python for its great data analysis and plotting libraries, as well as OpenCV, which made the computer vision
                    elements possible.

                    Before beginning to build the program, I did lots of research on currently existing exercise software, as
                    well as the types of users that would be interested in and benefit from the system.

                    This project is still something I'm proud of and it was great fun to build, especially testing the computer vision
                    elements.
